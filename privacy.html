<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date: February 25, 2026</strong></p>

<p><strong>Faaah! Twitter Like Sound</strong> ("the Extension") is a simple Chrome extension that plays a short "faaah" sound locally in your browser whenever someone likes one of your posts on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>We take your privacy very seriously. This policy explains that the Extension does **not** collect, store, transmit, or share any user data.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>The Extension does **not** collect, store, log, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive information, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personally identifiable information (name, email, username, etc.)</li>
  <li>Website content beyond transient observation needed to detect a like event</li>
  <li>Web browsing history, user activity (clicks, scrolls, keystrokes), location, or any other behavioral data</li>
  <li>Authentication information, financial data, health data, communications, or anything else</li>
</ul>
<p>All functionality (sound playback) happens **entirely locally** in your browser. No data ever leaves your device or is sent to any server (including ours).</p>

<h2>2. How the Extension Works (Limited Data Access)</h2>
<p>To detect when someone likes your post, the Extension requires access to <code>x.com</code> and <code>twitter.com</code> pages (via host permissions in the manifest). It uses a content script to observe specific visible changes on your own profile, notifications, or tweet pages (e.g., like count increase or notification element).</p>
<p>This is strictly limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Triggering a local audio file playback</li>
  <li>No reading, storing, or using any tweet text, usernames, follower counts, or other content</li>
  <li>No modification of page content</li>
  <li>No logging or analytics</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight">
  <strong>Limited Use Disclosure (Chrome Web Store Requirement)</strong><br>
  Any transient access to website content adheres to Google's Limited Use requirements: the Extension only uses accessed data to provide the single user-facing feature (playing a sound on likes) as prominently described in the Chrome Web Store listing and UI. We do not:
  <ul>
    <li>Use or transfer data for advertising, re-targeting, or interest-based purposes</li>
    <li>Allow human review of any data</li>
    <li>Transfer data except as required by law or for security/abuse prevention</li>
    <li>Use data for any purpose unrelated to the Extension's core function</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>3. Third Parties</h2>
<p>The Extension does not use any third-party services, APIs, analytics tools, ads, or trackers. The sound file is bundled locally (or loaded from a static source with no tracking).</p>

<h2>4. Security</h2>
<p>Since no data is collected or transmitted, there are no external security risks related to user data from this Extension.</p>

<h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>If the Extension is ever updated to handle data differently, we will update this policy and note changes in the Chrome Web Store listing. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

<h2>6. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any questions, contact me at: [your-email-here@example.com] (replace with your actual email)</p>

<p>This Extension complies fully with the Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies, including the User Data policy and Limited Use restrictions.</p>
